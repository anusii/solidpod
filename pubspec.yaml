# TODO 20240417 gjw We will want to get rid of these eventually. For
# example, even though intl 0.18.0 is otherwise required, we override
# with 0.19.0 to suit some package (SOMEONE FORGOT TO DOCUMENT WHY -
# PLEASE). But the apps need to also override it, which is really
# ugly. Maybe for file as well? WHY IS IT OVERRIDEN PLEASE.
